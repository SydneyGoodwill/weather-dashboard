# Purpose

An application where the user can see the weather outlook for multiple cities, so that they can plan a trip. This saves the user the hassle of having to check multiple cities' weather forecasts from multiple websites, saving time.

# Functioning the App

 Navigating a site that features dynamically updated HTML and CSS, the user will fill out form inputs and search parameters, which will result in that location's current weather conditions as well as information about the place. When the user view's future weather conditions for that location, they are presented with a 5-day forecast that displays the date, weather and other information.
